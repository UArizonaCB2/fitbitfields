Daily Data Summary

| Table | Field | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| fitbitdailydata | HeartRateIntradayCount | The number of intraday heart rate samples collected during the time period. |
| fitbitdailydata | HeartRateIntradayMinuteCount | The number of minutes throughout the day that have an intraday heart rate sample. This value approximates the time the device was worn. A value of 1439 or greater indicates a full day. |
| fitbitdailydata | HeartRateZoneCardioCaloriesOut
HeartRateZoneCardioMax
HeartRateZoneCardioMin
HeartRateZoneCardioMinutes | Fat burn, cardio, and peak are the three heart rate zones. They are personalized to each participant based on age and cardiovascular fitness level. To engage the cardio zone, participants may be running or biking.
Number of calories burned while in cardio zone.
A minimum and maximum heart rate that together define the cardio zone. For example: HeartRateZoneCardioMin of 94 and HeartRateZoneCardioMax of 132 mean that the cardio zone includes heart rates from 94-132.
Number of minutes spent in cardio zone. |
| fitbitdailydata | HeartRateZoneFatBurnCaloriesOut
HeartRateZoneFatBurnMax
HeartRateZoneFatBurnMin
HeartRateZoneFatBurnMinutes | Fat burn, cardio, and peak are the three heart rate zones. They are personalized to each participant based on age and cardiovascular fitness level. To engage the fat burn zone, participants may be lifting weights, taking a yoga class, or going on a fast walk.
Number of calories burned while in fat burn zone.
A minimum and maximum heart rate that together define the fat burn zone. For example: HeartRateZoneFatBurnMin of 94 and HeartRateZoneFatBurnMax of 132 mean that the fat burn zone includes heart rates from 94-132.
Number of minutes spent in fat burn zone. |
| fitbitdailydata | HeartRateZoneOutOfRangeCaloriesOut
HeartRateZoneOutOfRangeMax
HeartRateZoneOutOfRangeMin
HeartRateZoneOutOfRangeMinutes | Heart rate zones go in terms of intensity from peak to cardio to fat burn. Out of range zone means a participant fell below the threshold of fat burn zone. Zones are personalized to each participant based on age and cardiovascular fitness level.
Number of calories burned while out of range.
A minimum and maximum heart rate that together define the out of range zone. For example: HeartRateZoneOutofRangeMin of 94 and HeartRateZoneOutofRangeMax of 132 mean that the out of range zone includes heart rates from 94-132.
Number of minutes spent out of range. |
| fitbitdailydata | HeartRateZonePeakCaloriesOut
HeartRateZonePeakMin
HeartRateZonePeakMax
HeartRateZonePeakMinutes | Fat burn, cardio, and peak are the three heart rate zones. They are personalized to each participant based on age and cardiovascular fitness level. To engage the peak zone, participants may be sprinting or biking up a steep hill at a fast pace.
Number of calories burned while in peak zone.
A minimum and maximum heart rate that together define the peak zone. For example: HeartRateZonePeakMin of 94 and HeartRateZonePeakMax of 132 mean that the peak zone includes heart rates from 94-132.
Number of minutes spent in peak zone. |
| fitbitdailydata | HrvDailyRmssd | The Root Mean Square of Successive Differences (RMSSD) between heart beats. It measures short-term variability in the user‚Äôs daily heart rate in milliseconds (ms). |
| fitbitdailydata | HrvDeepRmssd | The Root Mean Square of Successive Differences (RMSSD) between heart beats. It measures short-term variability in the user‚Äôs heart rate while in deep sleep, in milliseconds (ms). |
| fitbitdailydata | RestingHeartRate | Average resting heart rate. |
| fitbitrestingheartrates | RestingHeartRate | The average resting heart rate for the day. |
| fitbitactivitylogs | AverageHeartRate | The user's average heart rate during the activity. |

HeartRateZonePeakMax
HeartRateZonePeakMin
HeartRateZonePeakMinutes | For an activity, Fitbit tracks various heart rate "zones", like "Fat Burn" or "Cardio". For each zone, it reports:
‚Ä¢ The minimum and maximum heart rates that define the zone. For example: the "Fat Burn" zone might be between 93 and 130.
‚Ä¢ The number of minutes the user spent in that zone during the activity. |
